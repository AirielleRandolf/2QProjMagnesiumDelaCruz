            <p>The pandemic has severely affected the lives of many all across the globe, from poverty to loss of loved ones. The pandemic has brought devastating effects to global economy, and it would require the sacrifice of many to initiate financial recovery. Some countries have fortunately been rid of the virus, but many others still suffer from its effects.</p>

            <p>A common effect of the pandemic is the loss of jobs. Due to the lockdown, work is either unavailable or is done remotely usually through the Internet, and the same goes with education in schools. This has not only forced people to stay inside their homes, but forced them to be isolated from their friends or from the people that they care about. While it can be solved by online communication, the effects on people's mental healths that this can bring is significant.</p>

            <p>Another effect that the pandemic has is the loss of jobs and, subsequently, poverty. According to a statement by the WHO on the impact of the pandemic (2020), more than a billion people in the workforce are at risk of losing their jobs, and over 130 million people are expected to become undernourished by late 2020.</p>

            <p>Many children and families are starving and becoming malnourished not only due to the mass poverty that the pandemic brings, but also because of the food scarcity that happens as a result of its high demand.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the physical effects of the virus must also be recognized. People who get the virus run the risk of getting hospitalized, and even worse, death. As of early 2022, there are already more than 6 million deaths from COVID-19 all around the globe. Many lives have been taken by this catastrophe.</p>

            <p>And as such, it is important that we must all cooperate and follow health guidelines in order to get ourselves and others out of danger. And that it is also important for governments and nations to respond to the threats of COVID-19, and its ever growing list of mutations, in a careful but urgent manner. Otherwise, this disaster that we're in will only continue.</p>
